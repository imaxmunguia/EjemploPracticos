The example demonstrates how to customize the background color and text for a particular day in <strong>RadCalendar</strong>. This is accomplished through the <strong>DayRender</strong> event which is fired after the generation of content for every calendar cell object. It can be used to make changes to the calendar cells' content before the rendering.
