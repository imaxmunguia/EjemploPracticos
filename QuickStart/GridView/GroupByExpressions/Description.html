This example demonstrates how to use GroupByExpressions in <strong>RadGridView</strong> to create group-by expressions, display additional information in each group header - like aggregate fields, and to dynamically add a "SubTotal" to each group, handling grid's grouping events. You can also test the expressions syntax:<br /><i>fieldname[ as alias] [format "..."]|aggregate(fieldname|alias)[as alias][, ...] Group By fieldname|alias [ASC|DESC] </i><br />where: <b>fieldname</b>: is the name of any field from the DataSource; <b>alias</b> is the alias string, which cannot contain blanks or other reserved symbols like &#39;,&#39;, &#39;.&#39; etc.;<b> aggregate</b> is any function: <i>min, max, sum, count, last, first</i> etc (the same as in GridAggregateFunction enumeration); and the <b>format</b> string is identical to the one used with <em>string.Format</em>, where the first argument is the field name or the alias and the second one is the actual value. The default value is "{0}: {1}"<br/><b><i>Example</i></b>: <b>Country, City, count(Country) Items, ContactName Group By Country, City desc</b>
