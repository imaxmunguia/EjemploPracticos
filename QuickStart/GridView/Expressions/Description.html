A computed column is identified by an expression. The expression calculates a value by combining multiple columns of the same table using operators. You can use simple arithmetic operators like + and * as well as logical operators like = and &lt;. Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) are allowed, as well as more complex operators like IN, LIKE, and % (modulus). Operators take the usual precedence that you can alter using parentheses at will. The following strings represent some feasible expressions for computed columns: <i>Country = 'USA' | Year &gt;= 1999 And LastName LIKE 'A%' | Price * 0.2 + Freight. </i>Column names can be used as keywords and must be unquoted. Names, instead, must always be single-quoted. Dates should be bracketed by the pound (#) character: <i>HireDate &gt; #2-1-2002#. </i>Wildcards like % and * are perfectly supported, but only at the beginning or the end of the string. The expression does not recognize enum values unless you cast them to the actual value and type. Decimal values can be used as long as you represent them with strings according to the current locale.
