RadApplicationMenu is the Telerik counterpart of the "application menu" introduced with Office 2007 as part of Microsoft’s Ribbon UI. It displays controls used to perform actions on entire documents and forms, such as Save and Print. It also provides a list of recent documents, access to form options, and the ability to exit the form or application.
