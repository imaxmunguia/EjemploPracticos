The Telerik RadMenu enables you to implement attractive navigation systems, comprised of classic or Office 2007-style menus. Based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, the component gives you full control over item appearance, orientation, and text-wrapping, while allowing you to easily nest checkboxes, images, or any other controls in design-time.
