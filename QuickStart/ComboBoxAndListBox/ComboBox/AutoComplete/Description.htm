<b>RadDropDownList</b> has full autocomplete support - as soon as the user starts typing, the combobox selects or fills-in the first matching entry from the list. The different autocomplete modes can be set through the <b>AutoCompleteMode</b> property and they are:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Suggest</i> mode the first item that starts with the entered text is automatically selected in the dropdown area.</li>
<li>In <i>Append</i> mode the first item that starts with the text is automatically appended in the text area, but the drop down area does not appear. </li>
<li>In <i>SuggestAppend</i> mode both of the above happen simultaneously. Autocomplete mode can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive </li>
</ul>
