This example demonstrates different selection modes in <strong>RadGridView.</strong> Currently, two selection modes are supported: <i>FullRowSelect</i> and <i>CellSelect.</i> In <i>FullRowSelect</i> mode you are able to select full rows in grid; in <i>CellSelect</i> mode you are able to select single cells. If the <strong>MultiSelect</strong> property of <strong>RadGridView</strong> is set to false, you can select only one row or cell, depending on the current selection mode.
