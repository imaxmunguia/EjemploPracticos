The Telerik <strong>RadWaitingBar</strong> control is designed to let the user know that a long-running application is proceeding at an indeterminate length. Unlike the Telerik <strong>RadProgressBar</strong> control, the <strong>RadWaitingBar</strong> does not display an indication of percent finished. Instead, it smoothly animates a block across a rectangle image that appears in the background as long as the operation continues.
