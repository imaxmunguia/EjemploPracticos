The <b>ShapedForm</b> descends from a standard windows Form and comes with a RadTitleBar so the user can move, close, minimize and maximize the form. Both the <b>RadTitleBar</b> and the <b>ShapedForm</b> by default each have their <b>Shape</b> property set to <b>RoundRectShape.</b> You can use one of the predefined shapes or create a custom shape using the Shape Editor tool.<br>The <b>ShapedForm </b>treats the whole space as its client area. When you dock a control in the form, it can cover the border of the window and disable form resizing. You can change the form's Padding to make sure this area stays clear, or anchor a panel that will contain all the controls for the form.<br>Note: In order to hide the default titlebar, the <b>ShapedForm</b> class has the <b>FormBorderStyle</b> property set to None while the RadForm FormBorderStyle property by default is set to Sizable. This may impact form behavior in some cases.
