This example demonstrates the dynamic creation of ToolWindow instances and the AutoHide feature of the Docking Manager. RadDock provides a container that holds dockable windows. This container can fill the entire client area of a Windows Form, or can be limited to any rectangular area you choose to manage. You can mix a docking implementation with traditional Windows Forms or Telerik RadControls on the same form.
