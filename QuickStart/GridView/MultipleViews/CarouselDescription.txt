Supple views are a ControlDefault with RadGridView’s Multi-Row Headers. The flexible layout for displaying data is achieved either through simple HTML or through a dedicated ColumnGroupsView, both enabling column grouping and row layout customization. The three supported views are: TableView - this is the default view; ColumnGroupsView - enables columns grouping and customizing the row layout; and HtmlView - the row layout is specified exactly like an HTML table.
