    In this example, <strong>RadMenuStrip</strong> is assigned shortcuts that are managed by the
<strong>Shortcuts</strong> component - the base of the whole shortcuts system implemented
for the descendents of <strong>RadControl</strong> and <strong>RadItem</strong>. The component serializes InputBinding
objects as a collection. Every InputBinding object binds keyboard shortcut used
for activation, a valid Command instance, and a command context which is the object
that will be the target of the command's execution. Commands are implementations
of the Command pattern - objects that are capable of certain actions on a
specific type of objects, encapsulating the knowledge how to perform the
requested action.</p>
