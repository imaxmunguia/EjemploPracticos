The appearance of the menu can be modeled entirely with images, without using skins or Themes. The <strong>RadMenuItem</strong> class exposes the <i>Image</i> property which you can use to set the image. You can also add an image list to your menu by setting the <i>ImageList</i><strong> </strong>property, either via Visual Studio or programmatically. If you set the images programatically, you can have one image for the initial state of a menu item and another image for the hover state. Just use the <strong>ImageList</strong> to set the images.
