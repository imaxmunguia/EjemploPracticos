RadTimePicker support showing time in different formats and cultures. The current example demonstrates what are the drop-down capabilities of RadTimePicker and it also demonstrates <strong>RadClock</strong> control - an analog clock that you can use outside the context of <strong>RadTimePicker</strong> to show time.
