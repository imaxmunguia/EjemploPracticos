In this example we have attached a specific behavior to each <b>RadComboBoxItem.</b> The behavior activates a <b>ZoomPopup</b> element each time the mouse cursor hovers a given ComboBox item. The same behavior could be successfully applied to each item which derives from <b>RadElement/RadItem,</b> i.e. <strong>RadMenuItem, TabItem, RadButtonElement,</strong> etc.
