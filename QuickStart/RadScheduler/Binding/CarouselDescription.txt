Mapping of scheduler properties to data source properties is easy with RadScheduler through the AppointmentMappingInfo and ResourceMappingInfo classes. With these strongly typed MappingInfo classes, all you have to do is set the names of your data source fields. RadScheduler also permits not only basic, but advanced properties to be saved in the data source, such as properties, related to assigned and recurrence rules (the recurrence rules are saved as an iCal format ted string).
