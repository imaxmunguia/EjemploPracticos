The <strong>Bubble Chart</strong> illustrates data that is composed of value pairs. It is an XY chart type, which uses four measures. The XValue and YValue properties of the series data item specify the position of the bubble on the chart and the XValue2 and YValue2 specify the bubble's width and height according to the X and Y axes respectively. You can fill the bubble with solid, gradient, hatched or custom images fills as well as add custom labels and position them on different places in relation to the bubble.
