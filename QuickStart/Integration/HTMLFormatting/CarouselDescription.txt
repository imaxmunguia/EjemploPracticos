RadControls for WinForms provide an advanced text styling mechanism, which can be applied to all Telerik products, because it enhances the smallest element in the Telerik Presentation Framework - the text primitive. The new rich text formatting mechanism uses plain HTML tags to display formatted text such as font style, font color, fontSystem.Drawing.Size options and simple layouts.
