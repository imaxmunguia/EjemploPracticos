<p>This example mimics a browser and exhibits the types of items <strong>RadToolStrip</strong> supports: <em>Telerik Buttons, </em> <em>Separators,</em> <em>images,</em> <em>text boxes,</em> <em>drop downs,</em> and more.</p><p>This example also shows Telerik <b>RadCommandBar's</b> Overflow support and support for shrinkable toolbars, which are very handy for limited window space (for example when the form is resized).</p>
