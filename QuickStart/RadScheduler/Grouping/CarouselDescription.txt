The Scheduler control by Telerik allows you to define custom resources that can be assigned to the appointments. Custom resources let you associate additional information with your appointments, where the information for each field can be selected from a limited number of possibilities. For example you can load the appointments of different users on a single scheduler by simply choosing the name of the user. The same applies for various resources such as meeting rooms, team events, etc.
