This example demonstrates the Telerik <strong>RadScrollViewer</strong>. The scroll viewer below contains a rectangle and a triangle, which can be added or removed from the area, which in turn changes theSystem.Drawing.Size of the content area. The fill primitive of the scroll viewer can also be added or removed, but it does not modify the content areaSystem.Drawing.Size. You can resize the form in order to resize the <strong>RadScrollViewer</strong>. If an element (the square or the triangle) is not visible, you can scroll to it using the buttons at the bottom.
