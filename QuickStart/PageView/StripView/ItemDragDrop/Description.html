<b>RadPageView</b> allows you to reorder its items in two different modes:<ul><li>
<li>Preview: A snapshot of the dragged item is generated and a hint, indicating the new insert index is displayed.</li>
<li>Immediate: A dragged item is immediately inserted when appropriate new position is found.</li></ul>
