The Column Chooser is a form which can be used to show/hide available columns in <strong>RadGridView.</strong> It is invoked by right-clicking on any column header and selecting Column Chooser from the context menu. Columns can be dragged and dropped from the control to the Column Chooser and vice versa. Anytime a column is removed from <strong>RadGridView,</strong> it appears in the Column Chooser.
