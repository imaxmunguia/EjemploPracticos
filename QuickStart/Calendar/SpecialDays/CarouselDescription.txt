A collection of dynamic templates can be used for achieving rich presentation of the calendar days. You can use this customization on a "per day" basis. It is especially useful if you want to implement a scheduler-like interface with additional information and images about events, links to various resources, etc. Other RadControls for WinForms are also supported in the template.
