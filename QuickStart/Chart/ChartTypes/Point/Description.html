The <strong>Point Chart</strong> illustrates data that is composed of value pairs. It is an XY chart type, which uses three measures. The first two (XValue, YValue) specify the System.Drawing.Point location of the chart. The third specifies System.Drawing.Point radius in points. As a System.Drawing.Point mark you can use Circle or Rectangle. The System.Drawing.Point can be filled with a solid, gradient, hatched or custom image fill.
