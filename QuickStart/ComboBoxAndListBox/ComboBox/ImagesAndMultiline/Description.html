This example demonstrates a <strong>RadDropDownList</strong> with images and multi-line text in its items. <i>Autocomplete</i> is turned on and is set to <i>SuggestAppend.</i> The <i>DblClickRotate </i>property is set to <i>true,</i> so you can navigate to the next item in the DropDownList by double clicking in the text area. In the Configurator you can view and edit properties for the currently selected <strong>RadDropDownListItem.</strong> Use <i>Add New</i> to create a new item, and <i>Remove </i>to remove the selected item.
