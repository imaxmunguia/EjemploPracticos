The visual appearance of the <strong>RadDropDownList</strong> can be customized through the comprehensive Theming mechanism which Telerik provides, both in design-time or run-time. You can use the <strong>Visual Style Builder</strong> to create a theme, or load a preset Theme from the button at the top of the example window.
