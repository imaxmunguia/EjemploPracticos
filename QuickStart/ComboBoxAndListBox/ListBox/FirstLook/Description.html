<b>RadListControl</b> is a themable listbox control that displays a list of items which you can select. It exposes two multi-selection modes: MultiSimple and MultiExtened. While the former selects and deselects items independently one of another, the latter requires the user to hold the Ctrl key in order to select multiple items.
