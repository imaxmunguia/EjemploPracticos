For enhanced readability and usability of the displayed data, <b>RadGridView</b> enables users to apply <i>conditional formatting</i> to grid elements. In addition to using the extended event-based cell presentation mechanism, they can achieve advanced graphical appearance by only modifying the cells’ visual properties. Data is formatted based on user-specified rules with the help of the intuitive MS Excel-like Conditional Formatting dialog, which is called upon right-clicking anywhere in the GridView.
