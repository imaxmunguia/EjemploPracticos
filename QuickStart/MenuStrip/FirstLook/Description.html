The Telerik <b>RadMenu</b> enables you to implement attractive navigation systems, comprised of classic or Office 2007-style menus. Based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, the component gives you full control over item appearance, orientation, and text-wrapping, while allowing you to easily nest checkboxes, images, or any other controls in design-time.<br>This example demonstrates the power of <strong>RadMenu,</strong> as well as its visual appearance. The menu can be enabled by clicking on one of the images underneath it, similar to Image Photo Gallery in Windows Vista. In this example, <strong>RadMenu</strong> is also assigned shortcuts that are managed by the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> component - the base of the whole shortcuts system implemented for the descendents of <strong>RadControl</strong> and <strong>RadItem.</strong> The component serializes InputBinding objects as a collection. Every InputBinding object binds keyboard shortcut used for activation, a valid Command instance, and a command context which is the object that will be the target of the command's execution. Commands are implementations of the Command pattern - objects that are capable of certain actions on a specific type of objects, encapsulating the knowledge how to perform the requested action.
