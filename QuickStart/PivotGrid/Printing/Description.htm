RadPivotGrid provides native printing support with a bunch of customization settings for the printing layout. This example demonstrates how easily you can send your privatized reports to the printer, and open the Print preview or Print settings dialogs to fine-tune your printing layout. You can set page headers, page footers, watermarks and adjust the paper size settings.
